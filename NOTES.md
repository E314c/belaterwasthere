## Behaviour
- Script tags injected in the to `<head>` of the webpage
  - Script tag is obfuscated and uses `eval(String.fromCharCode(`
- Script adds a new script tag, directing to load a script from : `https://bes.belaterbewasthere.com/corn/flex.js?tp=799`
- _The script does something_: Yet unsure of exactly what happens
- Page is redirected to `https://capital.belaterbewasthere.com/len.php?s=678&_id=129843478&utm=gfhklew45`
- The browser gets redirected to one of the secondary domains
- The `greenrelaxfollow` and `redrelaxfollow` pages attempt to force a user to allow notifications.
